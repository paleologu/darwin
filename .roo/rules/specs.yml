    description: "No implementation code should exist without a failing test first."
  - name: Contextual Specs
    description: "Each spec must describe behavior in context — e.g. 'Darwin::Runtime.reload_all!' should rebind constants idempotently."
  - name: Fixture Safety
    description: "Specs must use setup_test_data! helper; direct DB manipulation is forbidden."
  - name: In-Memory Isolation
    description: "All specs should run against the in-memory test DB defined in rails_helper.rb."
